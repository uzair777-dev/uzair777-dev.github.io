      <content>
        This is the content that will be visible when the user clicks on any card in the devlog list.
        This can have multiple lines.
        This can also have html tags for flexibilty
        For exxample 
        <i>This is sentence is in italics</i>
        <b>This sentence is in bold</b>
        or i could just do <i><b>this word</b></i> in bold and italics 
        Also it supports my own custom schenaigans like for example censoring.
        like this :
        <censor>This sentence is censored</censor>
        You can unhide this 
        Or you could censor a particular word for example this<PCensor>word</PCensor>. 
        Or Giched texts like this: <glitch intensity="2">abracadabra</glitch>
        and this is heavy glitched <glitch intensity="10"></glitch>
        Here only w is visible, everything else is just asterisk. This applies to each word so its not the whole sentence

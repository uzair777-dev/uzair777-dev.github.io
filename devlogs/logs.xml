      <content>
        This is the content that will be visible when the user clicks on any card in the devlog list.
        This can have multiple lines.
        This can also have html tags for flexibilty
        For exxample 
        <i>This is sentence is in italics</i>
        <b>This sentence is in bold</b>
        or i could just do <i><b>this word</b></i> in bold and italics 
        Also it supports my own custom schenaigans like for example censoring.
        like this :
        <censor>This sentence is censored</censor> PS: it says 
        It is repalced by full block, U+2588 (█). 
        Or you could censor a particular word for example this<PCensor>word</PCensor>. 
        Here only first and second last word is visible, everything else is just asterisk aka (*).Why you ask? My <PCensor>Fxxxxng</PCensor> will. 
        This applies to to whole sentences, applying to every word od the sentence.
        Or Giched texts like this: <glitch intensity="2">abracadabra</glitch>
        and this is heavy glitched <glitch intensity="10"></glitch>
        The glitch works by fetching fonts from the fonts directory, counting the numbers of letters betwwen the tag(excluding spaces), or if none is given just guesses a random number between 3 and 7 and then replaces the font of every letter with a random font, also while replacing the letter to a random letter. I know, confusing. Also this is controlled by the intensity which has a range of 2 to 10 (could go up but,imma get dizzy)

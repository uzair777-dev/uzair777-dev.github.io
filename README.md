# [uzair777-dev.github.io](http://uzairshaikh.pages.dev)

This is my portfolio website source code.

You can use it for your own website under the licence GPLv3 (if you what that means)

I'll explain everything below if I don't get distracte- *Ooo a butterfly* 🦋 ✨ 

---------------------------

## Disclaimer:

I am not particularly a good web-dev. So the styling is very 💩.

If you are gonna fork it. Please add some of your own styling. 

---------------------------

## How stuff works:

These are the following roles for the files

1. `./index.html` : It has the structure that has to be loaded before the stuff loads

2. `./app.js` : This is the brains of the website (I'll explain it later).

3. `./styles.css` : This is the styling. The ✨ Make it Look Good ✨ sauce 

4. `./data/global.json` : This contains the global setting that is default for the whole website. 

5. `./data/pages/page_name.json`: This contains page specific data to be loaded on the runtime

6. `./res/` : This contains the resources stuff etc idk idc 🫠

How shi works:

Basically when the page loads it runs the `app.js` and it dynamically places content from the various jsons and dynamically adjust the content. It basically does the heavy lifting of procedurally adding code and removing in response to user interaction and resouces (.jons) updateing in source

Truthfully, I am too lazy to update stuff everytime it is done, so i made it this way so it won't be a pain in the a*@h°le everytime
